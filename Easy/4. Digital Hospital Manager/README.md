# Digital Hospital Manager - Easy

> Date : 1st October 2020

## Prerequisites

- Basic input output of strings and numbers.
- One of `Class`/`Object`/`Dictionary`/`Map` to store survey details. (Depends on the language you are using)
- Creating and displaying arrays.
- Basic calculation.

## Problem Statement

Dr. Stephen Strange is the head of The Medical Association of Belgaum and is responsible to ensure the smooth functioning of the hospitals across the city. During COVID-19 crisis, the number of patients has surged significantly in one of the areas of the Belgaum, which has led to a shortage of isolation beds in that areas‚Äô hospitals. The patients are shifted to hospitals in other areas, but it takes time to check the availability of beds based on the other conditions of the patients (like age, other illnesses, budget for stay, etc.). This in turn creates panic among the patients and their family.

Dr. Strange realised the real reason is the absence of a generalised management system with hospitals following their own different protocols in the city. This leads to delay in updating information of all hospitals and patients in an ordered way at one common space. Taking this as an improvement opportunity, Dr. Strange is looking to get help from you to design an application which can help digitize such healthcare related maintenance issues.

He has laid down the initial set of requirements. Please refer to the following and quickly start with the implementation before the management of the healthcare system worsens.

### Inputs

The app should be able to maintain the medical record of each patient of a hospital with the following details -

- Patient Full Name
- Phone Number
- Emergency Contact Number
- Age
- Gender
- Blood Type
- Weight
- Height
- Symptoms/Medical Details

### Output

1. The app should be able to display all the patients data and the total number of patients admitted

| Patient ID (Autogenerate) | Patient Full Name | Phone Number | Emergency Contact Number | Age | Gender | Blood Type | Weight | Height | Symptoms/Medical Details | Date of Admission (Autofilled) |
| ------------------------- | ----------------- | ------------ | ------------------------ | --- | ------ | ---------- | ------ | ------ | ------------------------ | ------------------------------ |
|                           |                   |              |                          |     |        |            |        |        |                          |                                |

2. The app should be able to calculate, update and display the following statistics -
   - Total patients admitted on the current date
   - Total number of patients in hospital at the current time
