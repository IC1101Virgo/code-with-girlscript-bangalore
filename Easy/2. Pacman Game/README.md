> Date : 1st August 2020

## Prerequisites

## Problem Statement

All of us would have played the famous ‘PACMAN GAME’ in our childhood. 😃 The time has come to write code 👨‍💻👩‍💻 for the same!
The objective of the problem is to allow the Pacman to move along the walls of the maze. The code written should satisfy the requirements given below.

- Create a static 2D array that will represent a maze. There should be 3 types of characters stored in the 2D array.
  - One will represent a horizontal wall. (Ex: ‘-’)
  - One will represent a vertical wall. (Ex: ‘|’)
  - One will represent blank space. (Ex: ‘ ’)
  - One to represent the Pacman. (Ex: ‘@’)
  - Example ![Example image](../../assets/images/pacmanGameEasy.jpeg)

- The 2D array must have a minimum of 10 rows and 40 columns.
- When the app runs, the 2D maze should be displayed along with the horizontal & vertical walls, blank space, and the Pacman.
- When the arrow keys are pressed the Pacman should move in the respective direction. (The Pacman obviously cannot move through the walls)


### Inputs

The user should be able to control the pacman with arrow keys, or (W,A,S,D).

### Output

The maze should be displayed on the screen and the player should be able to control the pacman.
