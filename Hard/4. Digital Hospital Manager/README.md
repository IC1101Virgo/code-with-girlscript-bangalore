# Digital Hospital Manager - Hard

> Date : 1st October 2020

## Prerequisites

- Basic input output of strings and numbers.
- One of `Class`/`Object`/`Dictionary`/`Map` to store survey details. (Depends on the language you are using)
- Creating and displaying arrays.
- Basic calculation.
- Array filtering.
- Basic calculation.
- Reading and writing data to permanent storage. (files, database, etc) Refer [this](http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/files/) for using files in C++.
- Complex user interface for implementing different modes and features.

## Problem Statement

Dr. Stephen Strange is the head of The Medical Association of Belgaum and is responsible to ensure the smooth functioning of the hospitals across the city. During COVID-19 crisis, the number of patients has surged significantly in one of the areas of the Belgaum, which has led to a shortage of isolation beds in that areas’ hospitals. The patients are shifted to hospitals in other areas, but it takes time to check the availability of beds based on the other conditions of the patients (like age, other illnesses, budget for stay, etc.). This in turn creates panic among the patients and their family.

Dr. Strange realised the real reason is the absence of a generalised management system with hospitals following their own different protocols in the city. This leads to delay in updating information of all hospitals and patients in an ordered way at one common space. Taking this as an improvement opportunity, Dr. Strange is looking to get help from you to design an application which can help digitize such healthcare related maintenance issues.

Dr. Strange wishes to implement two sides to the app based on the type of user : Hospital Admin and Patient. **Hospital Admin** can access the app portal and perform operations on behalf of the hospital, etc. **Patient** can also access the app portal for his/her own individual use. Please refer to the following and quickly start with the implementation before the management of the healthcare system worsens.

     - PIN
   - Total Capacity- Number of Beds

2. The app should be able to maintain the medical record of each patient of a hospital with the following details
   - Hospital Name(Select from a list of registered hospitals)
   - Patient Full Name
   - Phone Number
   - Emergency Contact Number
